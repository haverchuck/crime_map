# Seattle Crime Map

Seattle Crime Map is an open-source web application that allows you to see when
and where crimes have occurred. One of the main features is the ability to view tweets that occurred around the time of the crime, and within a 0.5 kilometer radius.

To view the app, please follow this [link](https://stark-ocean-9319.herokuapp.com/).
