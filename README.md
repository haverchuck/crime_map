# CrimeMapper

### About

CrimeMapper is an open-source web application that allows you to see when and where crimes have occurred. How do we do this? Simple. The data comes directly from the Seattle Police Department's database. Our app simply offers a way to visually take note of the crimes that occur on a daily basis, not so different from how you would search for restaurants on Google Maps.

[comment]: <> (As a bonus feature, you have the ability to view tweets that occurred around the time of the crime, and within a 0.5 kilometer radius.)

To view our deployed app, please follow this [link](https://stark-ocean-9319.herokuapp.com/).

### How To Use this App

Step 1: Select one or more crime types using the search dropdown.

Step 2: Select a start date and end date using the calendar tool.

Step 3: Click the "Map Crimes" button.

Step 4: Click a popup on the map to get more info about that crime. Then, click the "Nearby Tweets" button to see tweets that are geotagged with a location near to the crime location.
